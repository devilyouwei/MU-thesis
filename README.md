## Abstract

Nowadays the most common and convenient way to look for information is searching on Internet. The top Internet search engines are handful, such Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, and so on. They use web crawler technologies to sniff the whole visible network and then provide users simple indexes and links as the results to help users find the source of resources. Most of those Internet search engines have good performance in terms of speed and precise keyword search ability, but wide-range search engines have their cons, such as massive potential results with uncertain quality. The goal of this project is to propose a new search engine, targeting on education, to provide ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù learning resources to users. High quality could be an subjective judgement and limited to the resources available for searching. In this project, it refers to means ‚Äúuser-trusted‚Äù or ‚Äúuser-liked‚Äù, based on common practices in education and learning. A few new search engine technologies are proposed to support efficient storage and enhanced searching for high-quality learning resources, in particular, to address two main issues: (1) how to build such a high-performance search engine; (2) how to define the quality of resources. The details include the strategies designed to optimize general information querying, storage, ranking, and most importantly, finding the relevant learning resources that are ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù for users. Prototyping and experimental study are conducted to conceptually prove this research.

## Assets List

-   thesis
-   presentation slides
-   images for thesis
-   UML files for thesis
-   code (full project refer to [myresource-vue](https://github.com/devilyouwei/myresource-vue) and [myresource-node](https://github.com/devilyouwei/myresource-node))
-   other documents (not thesis)

## Statistics

The statistics are generated randomly. Use the simulated data to test the search engine system.

### Dictionary

**Dic 1: 33 keywords**

```
Redis Remote Dictionary Server is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed The project is mainly developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo and as of 2019 is sponsored by Redis Labs It is open-source software released under a BSD 3-clause license
```

### Test Cases Table

The table data is used to test 3-layered storage for learning resource system.

-   33 keywords
-   4 keywords as test cases
-   index number based on 10, 10^0, 10^1, ... 10^6
-   static test results, without entering new rows of data
-   not random page, page 1

Note: million is the max data level, more data need opening to the public network.
