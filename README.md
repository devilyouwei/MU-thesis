## Abstract

You may say that we can use Google, Bing or Baidu to search the resources that we need by typing some keywords. These tools or websites that we call â€˜search engineâ€™, a search engine can use their web crawler technology to sniff the whole visible network and then provide users simple indexes and links as the results to help users find the source of useful resources. At present, the search engine on the internet has good performance and precise keyword search ability. Such a set of tools or websites have already covered most of our daily online searching life. So why does it need us to do the research on new search engines? These search engines have exposed more and more problems in some specific fields and groups. Letâ€™s begin with these problems and then do the research on â€˜search enginesâ€™ that developed in a special field, education and learning. This paper brings you a new set of search engine technologies and methods on searching valuable learning resources The research starts from the methods to define and normalize the quality and value of online learning resources through different key points. In order to prove such a theory, some experiments will be designed and done in a new resource search engine system.
